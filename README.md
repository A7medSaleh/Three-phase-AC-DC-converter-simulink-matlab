An AC/DC converter is a device used to obtain a constant DC voltage from an alternating power source. However in real life alot of power cables hold a three phase power signals so there is a need to have a converter that can deal with three phase power source.

In this model I have build a converter on simulink that simulates this process that can be used to study and simulate many applications like charging elctric cars batteries and much more, basically any application that requires a three phase AC/DC converter.
